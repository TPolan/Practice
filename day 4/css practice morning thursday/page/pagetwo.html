            <h2>Improve Branding for Your Product or Company</h2>
      
            <p>I’ve saved my favorite use of color for last. I just adore when color is critically used in <em>branding</em>. I don’t only mean just one hue or color set like for Kickpush or Bloom.</p>
      
            <p>Many of us have followed <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana’s redesign</a>, where they implemented various color gradients as part of their new identity. In some sections of the website, color is heavily used while in others not so much; it’s a balance. The colors are vibrant and different. The colors work well together, too. Now, Asana’s newest branding is vibrant and colorful. Asana is now bright pink, orange and purple. The color strategy seems to be a key in Asana’s brand positioning.</p>
      
            <p>The same thing can be said for <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, which might be a big trendsetter in this kind of color use. They use gradients between neighboring colors like blue and green. The branding is mostly blue but the designs don&#8217;t shy from including green, pink, purple or orange. Color choices work together and make impactful <em>branding</em> for Stripe.</p>
      
            <p>The last example is the website for <a href="https://www.discovergoulburnvalley.com/locations/jaques-orchard">Goulburn Valley</a>. Their branding uses slightly unusual colors. Yet, the design is very good.</p>
      
            <p>The landing page uses the same brand colors as in the screenshot throughout all of the photography. Green with hints of orange. It’s great to see that the colors weren’t just important for UI elements. The whole landing page flows well thanks to coordination of colors in the photographs.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>We are seeing more strategic use of color on websites, whether it is to create better branding like Asana or make a bold statement with a bright red background to make sure people realize you’re different like Kickpush.</p>
      
            <p>Above all, color helps bring about personality and, most notably, brand identity. The use of color in web design is only going to get better and stronger as designers grow even when web design trends change.</p>
